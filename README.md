Undergraduates find it hard to keep track of the many events happening in university as their inboxes are constantly flooded with event invitation emails. In fact, it has been calculated that students receive an average of 120 emails per week. With email and information overload, it is challenging for students to effectively explore extracurricular activities and they might even miss out on important updates from faculty members. As a result, the effectiveness of email as the main mode of communication between students and other stakeholders (faculty members and student bodies) is diminished.

The reason why we chose our target group is due to the prevalence of this issue among our fellow SMU undergraduates. This is backed up by interviews we conducted with students from different faculties, student body marketing representatives, and professors. Given that undergraduates are still learning about time management skills, while also attempting to explore their horizons through university events and activities, it is important that they should be able to plan out their university lives in a more effective and convenient manner while living their most exciting university life.

Our project, CalendaREADY enables students to view events based on their personal preferences. It is a platform for students to easily sign up for events, and the event details will be added to their calendar. All other information from clubs will be categorised in the Events Page, which mitigates the challenges caused by the flood of event invitation emails.
